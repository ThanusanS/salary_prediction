# 💼 Salary Prediction using AI for HR

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts employee salaries using **Machine Learning (Simple Linear Regression)**.  
It helps **HR teams** estimate fair salaries based on **years of experience**, reducing bias and improving decision-making.

The project demonstrates a **complete ML workflow** from data loading to model deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict employee salary accurately
- Understand the relationship between experience and salary
- Apply Simple Linear Regression in a real-world HR use case
- Build a beginner-friendly ML project

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pickle / Joblib**


---



## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is stored in CSV format and contains:
- **Years of Experience** (independent variable)
- **Salary** (dependent variable)

This project uses **one input feature**, making it ideal for Simple Linear Regression.

## 📐 Simple Linear Regression

### 🔹 What is Simple Linear Regression?
Simple Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm used to predict a **continuous value** using **one independent variable (X)** and **one dependent variable (Y)**.

In this project:
- **X:** Years of Experience  
- **Y:** Salary  

---

### 🔹 Mathematical Formula
- y=mx+c


Where:
- `y` = Predicted salary  
- `x` = Years of experience  
- `m` = Slope (salary increase per year)
- `c` = Intercept (base salary)

---

### 🔹 Why Simple Linear Regression?
- Easy to understand and explain
- Works well for linear relationships
- Beginner-friendly algorithm
- Commonly used in HR analytics

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1. Import required libraries
2. Load the CSV dataset
3. Select features (X) and target (Y)
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train the Simple Linear Regression model
6. Predict salaries
7. Evaluate model performance
8. Save the trained model
